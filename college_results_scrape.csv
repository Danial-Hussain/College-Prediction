"Decisions came in last night. It was my son’s dream school and both his dad and I went to undergrad and grad school there...back in the 90’s when BC beat ND in a memorable football game..haha. My son’s dreams were crushed last night when he was waitlisted...perpetuating the agony of the unknown! But to my surprise, his strong faith had made him realize that maybe his path is not what he thought he always wanted. He is looking at his second “favorite” school this weekend for his final decision. I see how hard some of you students work, you’re all amazing smart kids, and these schools look for perfection, but remember, that when you experience a roadblock, sometimes it just a path that will lead you exactly where you’re meant to be. For those on this thread that don’t get the decision they hoped for, have faith that things usually work out for the best and you will love wherever you decide to go! Good luck all!",,,,,,,,,
