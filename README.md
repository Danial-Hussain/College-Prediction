In this project, we will be attempting to predict college acceptance for undergraduate students into top 15 national universities. The universities covered in this project will be strictly colleges from the United States.
## Top 15 universites
In order to determine the top 15 universities in the United States, we will use the 2020 rankings published by U.S News
Here is a snippet of their selection process:
>Although our methodology is the product of years of research, we continue to refine our approach based on user feedback, discussions with schools and higher education experts, literature reviews, trends in our own data, availability of new data, and attending and sometimes presenting at professional conferences. Our detailed methodology is transparent in part for use by schools and researchers, but mostly because we believe prospective students will find our rankings more useful if they know what the rankings measure.
